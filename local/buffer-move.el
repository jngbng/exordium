;;;; buffer move


;; and you want to have :

;; +--------------+-------------+
;; |              |             |
;; |    #gnus     |   .emacs    |
;; |              |             |
;; +--------------+-------------+
;; |                            |
;; |           #emacs           |
;; |                            |
;; +----------------------------+

;; With buffer-move, just go in #gnus, do buf-move-left, go to #emacs
;; (which now should be on top right) and do buf-move-down.

;; To use it, simply put a (require 'buffer-move) in your ~/.emacs and
;; define some keybindings. For example, i use :

;; (global-set-key (kbd "<C-S-up>")     'buf-move-up)
;; (global-set-key (kbd "<C-S-down>")   'buf-move-down)
;; (global-set-key (kbd "<C-S-left>")   'buf-move-left)
;; (global-set-key (kbd "<C-S-right>")  'buf-move-right)


;;; Code:


(require 'windmove)


;;;###autoload
(defun buf-move-up ()
  "Swap the current buffer and the buffer above the split.
If there is no split, ie now window above the current one, an
error is signaled."

;;  split, if possible."

      ;; swap top with this one
      (set-window-buffer (selected-window) (window-buffer other-win))
      ;; move this one to top
